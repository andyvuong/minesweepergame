Minesweeper v1.00
=================
This is a personal project I began as a way to improve my experience with Java and solidify concepts I had learned in my CS125 (Intro to Programming) class at UIUC. It was also my first attempt at programming a GUI (using Java Swing) in hopes at becoming better at it. The main focus of the project was to learn how to program a GUI and learn Swing. As a result, there are some smaller details that are not present in the current version (Examples: Icons for mines, score display, etc).

Game Info
=========
This plays like a typical Minesweeper Game.

- Click tiles on a board
- A mine is represented by a negative 1. You lose if you click one.
- Other tiles have a value that represents the number of mines surrounding the current tile (adjacent and diagonal)

Notes
=====
Version 1.0
- No special visual elements (mines, etc).
- There is no victory screen or flags you can place.
- Just play until there are no more safe tiles on the board.
